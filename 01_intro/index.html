<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Pressure sensor for pistol grips </h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

In marksmenship thre are multiple fundemental tennents or rules that you have to follow in order to achieve a reliable and repeatable accurate shot. One of the tennents is proper tension in your grip. There are ways to evaluate which tennent you violeted when you have a mispalced shot i.e. if your shot is off on a horizontal axis it could be you are gripping the weapon to strongly with one hand or the other. If the shit is off on the vertical axis it could be due to breathing or squeezing the trigger to hard. It takes hundreds of hours and thousands of rounds to truly get a intuitive feel on how you should be holding your weapon and the proper amount of pressure required in your grip to place consistent accurate shots. By putting pressure sensors in the grip of the weapon you can get immediate feedback on how much pressure you are putting with one hand vs the other and adjust on the spot. Once you have found your own pressure ratio, you can use the device as a training tool to accuratly asses which tenent of marksmanship you are violating and quickly adjust.

<h4>Idea 2: Nicotine pouch container with digital display of content quantity </h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

The container will be a 3D printed canister with a pressure sensor that is calibrated for the weight of a single pouch. It will take the total weight of the contents and calculate the total number of pouches left in the container. As someone who uses nicotine pouches frequently I would like to use a single canister that can hold more than the standard amount of pouches in a purchased tin. This will also allow users to monitor the amount of pouches they consume allowing for self regulated use.

<h4>Idea 3: Automated cannabis grinder </h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

The grinder will be similar to a coffee grinder that you can set to desired coarseness. Like coffee afficiandos, those who are cannabis afficianados prefer a certain coarseness to their cannabis depending on modality of consumption. The grinder will have a scale displaying the weight of the loaded cannabis, a grinder that can be set to a desired coarseness, and the ability to have the ground cannabis emptied into a tray or a cone holder to hold prerolled cones or blunts.
