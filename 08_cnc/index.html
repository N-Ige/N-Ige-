<h3>Week 8: CNC Milling</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Make Something With CNC</h4>

For this assignment I wanted to make a six sided lantern to house a candle as the source of light. 

This was my inspiration for the product

Initially I thought this would be a rather quick build, as it goes with any project it took 12 hours longer than I thought it would. 
<br></br>
<li>
    The initial friction point I ran into was creating the platform that the candle and frame of lantern would sit. 
  </li>

  As I designed and cut the base the measurments were milimeters off and the collar would not sit properly

<br></br>

After I revised the measurements in Fusion with the help of Bobby, I was able to get the collar to sit properly. From there I had to design the lantern walls. I cut them using the laser cutter, however, I had issues with designing the walls to cast shadows. We revised the walls to project through the negative space of the designs vs throguh the cut hole of the design.

Once that was figured out, the rest of the time of the project was spent designing the walls in a combinaiton of Fusion and Rhino to get the final product
