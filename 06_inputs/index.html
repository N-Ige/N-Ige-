<h3>Week 6: Electronic Inputs</h3>

<h4>Assignment 1: Capactive Sensor<h4>
For my capacitive sensor I made a tilt sensor using copper strips and my nalgene. To gather data for my plot I used a protracter to measure the tilt of my bottle. 
<li>
    The bottle has a capcity to 32oz of water. I filled to 22oz of water
  </li>

<br></br>
<li>
    The data on the table reflects commonsence observations. As the bottle is moved from completley horizontal to vertical there is less water between the two strips of copper on my bottle, showing the spike of resistence and the leveling out as it becomes competley vertical with no water between the copper strips. 
  </li>

  <li>
    what I found the most intersting with the results is that there was a similar data read out as the bottle was compeltley vertical and completley horiontal. I thought there would be a greater difference as the volume of water between the two sensors changed.
  </li></li>

<h4>Assignment 2: [Use + Calibrate Another Sensor]</h4>
For the second sensor I began experimenting with velostat which I will be using for my final project. 
<li>
  I puta piece of adhesive copper strips on each end
 </li>
 <li>
  I then connect each lead to my arduino to measure the thresholds of resistence so I could program high and low parameters to trigger the LED. 
 </li>
 <br></br>
<img style = "width: 33vw;"src="./IMG_0419.jpeg" alt="generic placeholder image">
<br></br>
 <li>
By bending the velostat I can reduce resistence which will trigger the LED to light up
   </li>
